# Fullscreen video from webcam

A simple HTML video player, which will strem from the device's camera.

## Problem statement

When giving a presentation, it can be useful to show live video to the audience
(for instance, if you want to demo something on an external device).

One option for doing this might be to use a third party service, which we stream
live video to, which is then broadcasted to whoever is watching the stream on
this service.

However, for my purposes, doing this completely locally works (I will present
in person). I don't need any third party, or even internet.

## Solution

We simply render a video player in the browser. This can be opened during a
presentation.
